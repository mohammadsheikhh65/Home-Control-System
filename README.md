# Smart Home Appliance Control System

## Overview

This Smart Home Appliance Control System allows users to control various home appliances, including Light, Fan, and Air Conditioner. Each appliance has its own unique behavior for turning off:

- Light: Turned off by toggling the switch to the "off" position.
- Fan: Turned off by reducing its speed to zero.
- Air Conditioner: Turned off by setting its thermostat to the "off" mode.

The system also automatically performs a yearly update on January 1st at 1:00 AM local time, turning off all appliances during the update.
